A Python script, and GUI that allows a computer (or Raspberry Pi) to ID, and get and broadcast weather alerts. It then uses speach to broadcast the alerts over the sound card.  Simply plug in the headphone our audio output to a repeater or VOX input device.  Python scripts use import requests, feedparser, pyttsx3, time,logging,qt pyside6
Alerts come from the N.W.S. Alerts API, simply enter station ID.  It also shows latest N.W.S. Radar (currently defaults to Salem, IL where I'm from.)
